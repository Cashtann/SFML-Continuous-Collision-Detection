# SFML Collision System (Particle - Barrier) using Contiunous Collision Detection.

# Platform

Windows

This is my attempt to create collision system. For now (and the rest of its existence) I'm using **Continuous Collision Detection**.
I code it entirely myself as a challange, inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eED4bSkYCB8). 

I know this program **is not well optimized**, and it really wasn't supposed to be. I build this on top of my first project (contact) with SFML as one of many different ideas to implement. 
There is a bunch of unused or unnecessary code. 

I'm planning (and probably currently working on) to make a new, better and much more complex simulation than this one.

Again, it is **nothing special.**
