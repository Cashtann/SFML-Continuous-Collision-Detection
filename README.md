# This project is my attempt to learn **SFML**.

Because SFML is Windows specific (as far as I know and use it), I use Visual Studio 2022 to compile/build and run.

This project is my first "interaction" with SFML, nothing crazy, just some basics.

In here, I put my C++ "skills" to a test.

I'm tinkering with random, sometime weird, ideas.
